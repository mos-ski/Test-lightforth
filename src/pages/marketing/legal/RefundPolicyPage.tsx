              At Lightforth, we deliver digital services including AI-assisted resume curation, automated job
              applications, and interview preparation tools through a subscription-based model. Our services begin
              the moment users activate their accounts or features, and because they are <strong>intangible,
              personalized, and consumed in real-time</strong> refunds are generally <strong>not offered</strong>.
              However, we're committed to fairness, transparency, and helping you make the most of your career
              journey with us.
