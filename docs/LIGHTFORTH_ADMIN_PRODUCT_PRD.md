# Lightforth Admin and Operations Product PRD

**Version:** 2026-07-11  
**Status:** Current reference draft  
**Audience:** Product, design, engineering, QA, operations, support, marketing, sales, leadership  
**Scope:** Internal Lightforth operations, platform administration, business monitoring, user support, product configuration, and career specialist workflows.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Lightforth Admin and Operations product gives internal teams the visibility and controls needed to run the business. It supports revenue monitoring, user management, product analytics, pricing configuration, promotions, support, system notifications, broadcasts, audit logs, and career specialist operations.

This PRD is written for cross-functional stakeholders. It describes what each operational module must accomplish, who uses it, and how success is measured. It avoids implementation-specific language so product, design, engineering, marketing, sales, support, and leadership can use it as a shared reference.

## 2. Product Vision

The admin product should become the internal operating system for Lightforth. Every internal team should be able to answer its most important questions without asking engineering for raw data:

- Are users signing up, paying, and staying active?
- Which products are driving usage and revenue?
- Where are users getting stuck?
- Which support issues need attention?
- Which plans, promotions, and funnels are performing?
- Are students and job seekers receiving effective operational support?
- Are internal actions traceable and safe?
